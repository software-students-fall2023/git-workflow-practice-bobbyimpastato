## How ChatGPT is Redefining Software Development

The article argues that the recent breakthroughs in artifical intelligence will not be the end for human software development jobs, but increase the productivity of existing workers. The author argues that AI chatbots are serving roles as assistants that will increase workere productivity, reducing the time they spend on websites like StackOverflow. Engineers can also use the AI chatbots for "real time" feedback to bring faster awareness to any potential issues with their code---this will be espeically important regarding the continuous integration "CI/CD" pipeline which is often time consuming. I found this interesting as I want to become a software engineer, and some have expressed concern to me about AI affecting my career. I mostly agree with the author in this article, as AI needs a human to tell it what to do before it replaces some of the more time-consuming tasks.

## Comments

As an aspiring software developer as well, I too agree with the author that AI tools such as ChatGPT can increase the productivity of software development. I have used tools such as ChatGPT and Copilot in my own work for personal projects and I feel that it has helped me a lot. - Geoffrey Budiman
